## 🏢 AI-Powered Real Life Scenario Simulation Engine

## 🔥 Overview

This project is a cutting-edge **AI-driven simulation engine** that enables the simulation of **real-life scenarios inside real-world buildings** based on their **floor plans**. Utilizing AI agents, the system generates an **analytical report** that highlights:

- **Bottlenecks and inefficiencies** in building design.
- **Critical feedback** on overall building structure.
- **Emergency exit plans** and response effectiveness.
- **Recommended improvements** to enhance safety and usability.

The engine allows full customization of the **simulation timeframe** and **scenario context**, making it a powerful tool for architects, safety inspectors, and urban planners.

## 🚀 Features

✔ **AI-Driven Simulations** – Deploy AI agents to navigate and interact within the floor plan.  
✔ **Automated Floor Plan Processing** – Convert building layouts into structured JSON data using `FloorPlanProcessing.py`.  
✔ **Scenario Customization** – Modify the **simulation timeframe** and **scenario parameters** to fit different use cases.  
✔ **Comprehensive Reports** – Generate insightful **analytical reports** with critical evaluations and optimization recommendations.  
✔ **Emergency Planning** – Assess building safety, evaluate emergency exits, and improve evacuation strategies.  
✔ **Simple API Integration** – Seamless connection via an `.env` file for API access.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1️⃣ **Clone the repository**
```sh
   git clone https://github.com/laksord/SimAI.git
   cd SimAI
```

2️⃣ **Generate the floor plan JSON & AI agents**
```sh
   python FloorPlanProcessing.py
```

3️⃣ **Set up your API key**
Create a `.env` file and add your API key:
```sh
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4️⃣ **Run the AI crew simulation**
```sh
   crewai run
```
**Finally read your report in output directory**
---

## 📊 Usage

Once the simulation is executed, the AI agents will **analyze** the floor plan and **run the given scenario**. At the end of the simulation, a **detailed analytical report** will be generated, containing:

- Identified bottlenecks 🛑
- Suggested structural improvements 🏗️
- Emergency exit strategies 🚨
- Critical feedback 📌

Use this data to enhance your building’s design, optimize space, and ensure **maximum safety and efficiency**.

---

## 🎯 Example Use Cases

- **Architectural analysis** – Evaluate the **flow of movement** within a structure.
- **Emergency response planning** – Simulate fire drills and **escape scenarios**.
- **Retail & commercial optimization** – Identify areas of **congestion and inefficiency**.
- **Workplace safety improvement** – Assess employee movement and **emergency protocol efficiency**.
- **Smart building AI integration** – Use simulation insights for **intelligent infrastructure** enhancements.
